### Introduction

This is a simple Instagram-style app where you browse and apply various filters to images. It serves as a demonstrator on how you can build a simple multi-page app in React, and how you can manage and maintain state across and within components.

A lot of online tutorials in React focus on building small, trivial proof-of-concepts that do a very good job of explaining the fundamentals of React. However, the question of "How can I prototype a basic mobile app, with state and navigation" often goes unanswered. In an attempt to answer the question of "How do I structure an app with multiple screens?" and "Where do I place my files?", I created this example as a tool for those wishing to learn React as a means of quickly implementing designs.

The app features a simple navigation that allows users to jump between its various screens. Among other things, this app showcases how you can use the React Router to implement tabbed navigation, and how to maintain state across different tabs.

This demonstrator app is designed for beginners wishing to learn React, or more specifically, how to create basic, interactive prototypes using the framework. It is a supplement to the materials taught in the course Technical Interaction Design at the IT University of Copenhagen.
